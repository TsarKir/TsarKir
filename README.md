## Hi there, my name is Kirill! ðŸ‘‹

My first degree is in medicine (medical oncology), but my passion for programming led me to transition into backend development. Currently, I am honing my skills as a student at School 21. <br>
I am actively developing as a Golang programmer, and in the future, I aim to pursue a PhD in the field of computer science.<br>
In love with programming, science, chess and bjj:) <br>
This is my Github with some educational and freelance repositories.
